This is an imaginary database, created for a college project, which took place over a period of about a year.   
Story of the database:
Our role is to create a fluid organization in the company, where each employee has their own truck, to keep track of our customers 
(company of origin, contact phone, name, etc.) and the orders they give. , which requires extra attention not to have, for example, 
two orders from two different customers in two different corners of the country with the same truck or driver in a short time, so as 
to avoid delays and have satisfied customers.
